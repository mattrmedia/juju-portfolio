{"pageProps":{"project":{"id":"project-4","title":"Color Street<sup>®</sup> Let's GLOW 2022","problem":"Color Street is hosting their annual sales meeting with over 3,500 live attendees. They need a logo for the theme “Let's GLOW,” as well as subthemes for their four general sessions. They also need a plan for environmental branding and wayfinding throughout the expansive Phoenix Convention Center, spanning two buildings, as well as the airport. They want their attendees to feel energized and have fun, and would love ideas for photo opportunities and interactive installations for their social media-savvy audience.","solution":"A logo is created for \"Let's Glow\" that takes homage from their previous year's \"Pave the Way logo,\" while remaining new and fresh. Over one hundred signs, banners, interactive displays, etc. are allocated throughout the venue. A traffic layout is created and pricing gathered to ensure all ideas fall within budget. I oversee a team of designers and delegate work, ensuring cohesiveness in brand along the way. Communication with the client, venue, and various vendors allows for a seamless, successful event in which attendees are engaged and the client is happy. Survey results showed that over 90% of attendees were satisfied with the brand and wayfinding. This event was L!VE's highest grossing event of 2022.","type":["environmental","logo"],"headerImage":{"src":"/assets/project-4-header.jpg","altText":"A view of a stage washed in blue lighting with oversized \"GLOW\" letters and several large projection screens"},"images":[{"src":"/assets/project-4-img-1.jpg","altText":"An image of beautiful artwork","grid":"full"},{"src":"/assets/project-4-img-2.jpg","altText":"An image of beautiful artwork","grid":"full"},{"src":"/assets/project-4-img-3.jpg","altText":"An image of beautiful artwork","grid":"half"},{"src":"/assets/project-4-img-4.jpg","altText":"An image of beautiful artwork","grid":"half"},{"src":"/assets/project-4-img-5.jpg","altText":"An image of beautiful artwork","grid":"full"},{"src":"/assets/project-4-img-6.jpg","altText":"An image of beautiful artwork","grid":"full"},{"src":"/assets/project-4-img-7.jpg","altText":"An image of beautiful artwork","grid":"half"},{"src":"/assets/project-4-img-8.jpg","altText":"An image of beautiful artwork","grid":"half"},{"src":"/assets/project-4-img-9.jpg","altText":"An image of beautiful artwork","grid":"full"},{"src":"/assets/project-4-img-10.jpg","altText":"An image of beautiful artwork","grid":"half"},{"src":"/assets/project-4-img-11.jpg","altText":"An image of beautiful artwork","grid":"half"}],"thumbnail":{"src":"/assets/project-4-thumbnail.jpg","altText":"An image of beautiful artwork","grid":"full"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
