{"pageProps":{"project":{"id":"project-14","title":"Outdoor Pursuits Spring Trips Poster","problem":"Outdoor Pursuits at Ball State University needs to advertise their spring trip offerings in the form of a poster to be displayed in the recreation center, as well as web banners, and TV display ads. They want a unique design to entice students to participate.","solution":"Rather than use photography, as was done in previous years’ posters, a technique was learned to take vector illustrations and make them look embroidered like a scout badge. Each trip had a badge made and was arranged on the poster like a Scout’s sash. This unique approach allowed us to push the idea even further, offering badge pins to each participant.","type":["illustration","publications"],"headerImage":{"src":"/assets/project-14-header.jpg","altText":""},"images":[{"src":"/assets/project-14-img-1.jpg","altText":"An image of beautiful artwork","grid":"full"},{"src":"/assets/project-14-img-2.jpg","altText":"An image of beautiful artwork","grid":"half"},{"src":"/assets/project-14-img-3.jpg","altText":"An image of beautiful artwork","grid":"half"},{"src":"/assets/project-14-img-4.jpg","altText":"An image of beautiful artwork","grid":"full"},{"src":"/assets/project-14-img-5.jpg","altText":"An image of beautiful artwork","grid":"half"},{"src":"/assets/project-14-img-6.jpg","altText":"An image of beautiful artwork","grid":"half"}],"thumbnail":{"src":"/assets/project-14-thumbnail.png","altText":"An image of beautiful artwork"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
