{"pageProps":{"project":{"id":"project-4","title":"Color Street<sup>®</sup> Pave the Way 2021","problem":"Color Street is hosting their largest annual sales meeting yet with over 3,000 live attendees. They have an existing event identity for “Pave the Way” but need guidance on how to apply it to environmental branding and wayfinding throughout the Orange County Convention Center, the second largest convention center in the US. They want their attendees to feel energized and have fun, and would love ideas for photo opportunities and interactive installations for their younger, social media-savvy audience.","solution":"Over one hundred signs, banners, interactive displays, etc. are allocated throughout the venue to be created in a very short turnaround. A traffic layout is created and pricing gathered to ensure all ideas fall within budget. I oversee a team of designers and delegate work, ensuring cohesiveness in brand along the way. Communication with the client, venue, and various vendors allows for a seamless, successful event in which attendees are engaged and excited to be a part of Color Street.","type":["environmental"],"headerImage":{"src":"/assets/project-4-header.jpg","altText":"A pop-up banner welcomes guests to the Discover Networking Lounge, an open space with charging tables, orange rugs and vinyl wrapped columns"},"images":[{"src":"/assets/project-4-img-1.jpg","altText":"An image of beautiful artwork","grid":"full"},{"src":"/assets/project-4-img-2.jpg","altText":"An image of beautiful artwork","grid":"half"},{"src":"/assets/project-4-img-3.jpg","altText":"An image of beautiful artwork","grid":"half"},{"src":"/assets/project-4-img-4.jpg","altText":"An image of beautiful artwork","grid":"full"},{"src":"/assets/project-4-img-5.jpg","altText":"An image of beautiful artwork","grid":"half"},{"src":"/assets/project-4-img-6.jpg","altText":"An image of beautiful artwork","grid":"half"},{"src":"/assets/project-4-img-7.jpg","altText":"An image of beautiful artwork","grid":"full"}],"thumbnail":{"src":"/assets/project-4-thumbnail.png","altText":"An image of beautiful artwork","grid":"full"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
