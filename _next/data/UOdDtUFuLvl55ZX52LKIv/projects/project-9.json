{"pageProps":{"project":{"id":"project-9","title":"Network of Executive Women Executive Forum 2019","problem":"The Network of Executive Women wants their nearly 300 executive level leaders to leave their event feeling inspired “to harness their personal power to create change.” With the target audience being executive level women, this event should feel sophisticated, elevated, and be an environment for attendees to relax and recharge. They need a logo and identity system, as well as environmental branding throughout the venue. ","solution":"The final \"Reframe\" identity is bold and emphasizes the desire for attendees to reflect inward on their influence and power to make change. The reflection and supporting graphic elements also allude to the venue location. This identity system is applied throughout the venue to direct attendees to various touchpoints and elevate the space.","type":["logo","environmental"],"headerImage":{"src":"/assets/project-9-header.jpg","altText":""},"images":[{"src":"/assets/project-9-img-1.jpg","altText":"An image of beautiful artwork","grid":"full"},{"src":"/assets/project-9-img-2.jpg","altText":"An image of beautiful artwork","grid":"half"},{"src":"/assets/project-9-img-3.jpg","altText":"An image of beautiful artwork","grid":"half"},{"src":"/assets/project-9-img-4.jpg","altText":"An image of beautiful artwork","grid":"full"},{"src":"/assets/project-9-img-5.jpg","altText":"An image of beautiful artwork","grid":"full"},{"src":"/assets/project-9-img-6.jpg","altText":"An image of beautiful artwork","grid":"third"},{"src":"/assets/project-9-img-7.jpg","altText":"An image of beautiful artwork","grid":"third"},{"src":"/assets/project-9-img-8.jpg","altText":"An image of beautiful artwork","grid":"third"}],"thumbnail":{"src":"/assets/project-9-thumbnail.png","altText":"An image of beautiful artwork"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
