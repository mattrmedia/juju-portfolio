{"pageProps":{"project":{"id":"project-6","title":"Network of Executive Women Leadership Summit 2020","problem":"Network of Executive Women is hosting their first virtual Summit for over 1,500 attendees. They want to capitalize on the momentum of the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests, and energize their attendees to create change for ALL women. They want their attendees to feel empowered regardless of their position or status. They are in need of an event identity and virtual event platform.","solution":"The final event identity uses a logo with a handwritten font, and supporting graphics with a collage-like feel, torn paper, jagged cut imagery, and simple doodles. The amateur, grassroots quality illustrates that anyone has the ability to lead change, regardless of title or seniority. These elements are applied to the studio set pieces, as well as the Pathable virtual  event platform.","type":["logo","digital"],"headerImage":{"src":"/assets/project-6-header.jpg","altText":""},"images":[{"src":"/assets/project-6-img-1.jpg","altText":"An image of beautiful artwork","grid":"full"},{"src":"/assets/project-6-img-2.jpg","altText":"An image of beautiful artwork","grid":"full"},{"src":"/assets/project-6-img-3.jpg","altText":"An image of beautiful artwork","grid":"full"},{"src":"/assets/project-6-img-4.jpg","altText":"An image of beautiful artwork","grid":"half"},{"src":"/assets/project-6-img-5.jpg","altText":"An image of beautiful artwork","grid":"half"},{"src":"/assets/project-6-img-6.jpg","altText":"An image of beautiful artwork","grid":"half"},{"src":"/assets/project-6-img-7.jpg","altText":"An image of beautiful artwork","grid":"half"}],"thumbnail":{"src":"/assets/project-6-thumbnail.jpg","altText":"An image of beautiful artwork"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
