{"pageProps":{"project":{"id":"project-3","title":"Network of Executive Women Leadership Summit 2019","problem":"Network of Executive Women wants their attendees to have fun networking and learning at Summit. They want them to leave Summit feeling energized and ready to work towards a new future for themselves and for all women. They are in need of an event identity system, as well as environmental branding throughout the venue. They want the event brand to feel bold, fun, and contemporary.","solution":"The final \"By Design\" identity is expressive and adaptable. The painterly quality speaks to \"making\" and creating, as mentioned in the event tagline. Supporting patterns and graphics are fun and bold, especially the pattern of women in profile, which showcases the inclusive and diverse nature of the Network of Executive Women. Wayfinding is created in accordance with traffic flow throughout the venue, as well as registration kiosks, a social media lounge, and more.","type":["environmental","logo"],"headerImage":{"src":"/assets/project-3-header.jpg","altText":"an image showing an event registration area inside a hotel lobby with red carpet, two white laminate desks have branded fronts with the Network of Executive Women logo and the words \"2019 Leadership Summit Self Check-in Badge Printing sponsored by Walgreens\", as well as the event logo \"By Design\" and an illustrated pattern of women's profiles colored orange and purple"},"images":[{"src":"/assets/project-3-img-1.jpg","altText":"An image showing an event logo identity system with main logo reading \"By Design: Seeing, Making, & Building a NEW Future\", secondary logos reading \"2019 Leadership Summit\" and \"By Design\", color palette including shades of purple and orange as well as patterns with illustrate women's facial profiles, female symbols and brush strokes","grid":"full"},{"src":"/assets/project-3-img-2.jpg","altText":"A page from a PDF showing a hotel floorplan labeled with wayfinding locations, a mockup of registration area and 3D rendered desk with event branding","grid":"full"},{"src":"/assets/project-3-img-3.jpg","altText":"Attendees at an event check in at a registration desk branded with the event logo, a banner overhead reads \"Welcome to the NEW 2019 Leadership Summit, By Design, Registration & Member Services courtesy of: Walgreens\"","grid":"half"},{"src":"/assets/project-3-img-4.jpg","altText":"Two businesswomen in dresses have a conversation next to a sign with registration check-in instructions \"Self Check-in Badge Printing: 1.
